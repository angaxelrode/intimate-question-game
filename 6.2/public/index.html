     <h1> Welcome! </h1>
    <p> 
        This is a thoughtful space designed to foster deeper conversations and meaningful connections. Whether youâ€™re on a first date, getting to know someone, or simply want to engage in a more intimate conversation, we offer a curated set of 12 questions to help you break the ice and gradually dive deeper into personal and intimate topics. 
        <br> <br> Questions 1-12 go from surface, to more intimate, to more sexual, to ask your special someone. To go through each question, type /1 at the end of the server name for question 1, and /2 for question 2, and so on. For question 3, it would look like this "http://localhost:3000/questions/3". Have fun!
